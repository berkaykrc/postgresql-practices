Q: How can you produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court? Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by the member name followed by the facility name.

A: SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname || ' ' ||m.surname AS member,f.name as facility from cd.members m
JOIN cd.bookings b USING(memid)
JOIN cd.facilities f USING(facid)
WHERE f.name LIKE '%Tennis Court%'
ORDER BY member,facility;
