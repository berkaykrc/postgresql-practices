Q: How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named 'David Farrell'?

A: /*SELECT starttime 
FROM cd.bookings
WHERE memid = (SELECT memid FROM cd.members WHERE firstname = 'David' AND surname='Farrell')*/

SELECT bks.starttime 
FROM cd.bookings bks
INNER JOIN cd.members mems USING(memid)
WHERE mems.firstname='David' AND mems.surname='Farrell';
