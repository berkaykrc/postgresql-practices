Q: How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname pairing is formatted as a column and ordered.

A: SELECT DISTINCT m.firstname || ' ' ||m.surname as member, (SELECT r.firstname || ' ' || r.surname from cd.members r where r.memid=m.recommendedby) as recommender
from cd.members m
order by member
