Q: How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries.

A: SELECT m.firstname || ' ' || m.surname AS member, f.name as facility, 
       b.slots * (CASE WHEN b.memid = 0 THEN f.guestcost ELSE f.membercost END) AS cost
FROM cd.members m
JOIN cd.bookings b USING(memid)
JOIN cd.facilities f USING(facid)
WHERE DATE(starttime) = '2012-09-14' 
      AND b.slots * (CASE WHEN b.memid = 0 THEN f.guestcost ELSE f.membercost END) > 30
ORDER BY cost DESC;
