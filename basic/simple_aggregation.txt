Q: You'd like to get the signup date of your last member. How can you retrieve this information?

A: /*SELECT joindate AS latest from cd.members 
ORDER BY joindate DESC
LIMIT 1*/

WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT joindate, 
    RN = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY joindate DESC)
    FROM cd.members
)
SELECT joindate
FROM CTE
WHERE RN = 1
