Q: Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else:

Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.

A: INSERT INTO cd.facilities
    SELECT (SELECT MAX(facid)+1 from cd.facilities),'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800 --this is where I found out you can select query to use it as a value to insert
