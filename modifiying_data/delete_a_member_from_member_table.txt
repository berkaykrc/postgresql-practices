Q: We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, from our database. How can we achieve that?

A: DELETE FROM cd.members
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT memid FROM cd.bookings
    WHERE cd.bookings.memid = cd.members.memid
);
/* I came across another solution that I think is better for me. 
It's more readable and easier to understand. 
However, upon deeper reflection, I realized that this solution results in the deletion of all results, not just the members with ID 37. 
I only chose this solution because I knew that the only member who had never made a booking was the one with ID 37.
*/
--DELETE FROM cd.members
--WHERE memid = (SELECT memid FROM cd.members m 
			   --LEFT JOIN cd.bookings b USING(memid)
			   --WHERE b.memid IS NULL)
